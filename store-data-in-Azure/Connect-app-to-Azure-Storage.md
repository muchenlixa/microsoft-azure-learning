## Explore Azure storage services

Microsoft Azure Storage is a managed service that provides durable, secure, and scalable storage in the cloud.

A single Azure subscription can host up to 250 storage accounts per region, each of which has a maximum storage account capacity of five PiB.

### Data Types in Azure Storage Services

Azure storage includes four types of data:

- Blobs: A massively scalable object store for text and binary data; can include support for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
- Files: Managed file shares for cloud or on-premises deployments.
- Queues: A messaging store for reliable messaging between application components.
- Table Storage: A NoSQL store for schema-less storage of structured data. Table Storage isn't covered in this module.

You can access all of these data types in Azure Storage from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS. Microsoft provides SDKs for Azure Storage services in various programming languages, and in a REST API. You can also visually explore your data right in the Azure portal.
