## Introduction

DevOps is a concept that aims to address the challenges associated with traditional application lifecycle. 

Business case: a company plans to migrate an old app to a new app

Issue: development & operation teams have conflicting objectives
- development wants to release new feature ASAP
- operation wants to ensure stability and reliability 

## DevOps goals and benefits

- accelerating time to market
- adapting to market dynamics and compeition
- sustaining stability and reliability in operations
- minimizing the mean time to recovery

## Scrum

Scrum is a framework used by teams to manage work and solve problems collaboratively in short iterations called sprints. To facilitate collaboration and progress, sprints are structured based on events, artifacts, and roles. 

- Events, commonly referred as ceremonies, include meetings taking place daily (15 minutes max daily standup meeting) and at the beginning and end of each sprint.
- Artifacts define a prioritized list of features, enhancements, and fixes to develop. Artifacts might cover the span of a project or a sprint (Product Backlog or Sprint Backlog), or they might aid daily scrum meetings. A task board provides a visual way to track the progress of each backlog item. It displays backlog items divided into the tasks required to complete it. Tasks are placed in separate columns based on their status. The sprint burndown chart serves as a visual indicator of whether the team is on track to complete its assigned work by the end of the sprint. It consists of a graph that displays the daily total of remaining work, typically shown in hours. 
- Roles include the product owner, scrum master and scrum team, each with its clearly defined responsibilities. The product owner represents the project stakeholders and is responsible for defining, maintaining, and prioritizing the product backlog. The scrum master oversees the scrum process, looking for areas for improvements, resolving any blocking issues, and ensureing that the scrum principles are followed. The scrum team is responsible for building the product, with the ownership of its engineering and quality components.
