    "### Azure SQL services and capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure supports multiple database services, so that popular relational database management systems can be run in the cloud. \n",
    "\n",
    "Azure SQL is a collective term for a family of Microsoft SQL Server based database services in Azure:\n",
    "- SQL server on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) - a virtual machine running in Azure with an installation of SQL server (IaaS)\n",
    "- Azure SQL managed Instance - a plateform that provides near 100% compatibility with on-premise SQL Server instances while abstracting the underlying hardawre and OS (PaaS)\n",
    "- Azure SQL database - a fully managed, highly scalable PaaS datbase that designed for the cloud\n",
    "- Azure SQL Edge - a SQL engine that is optimized for Internet-of-things (IoT) scenarios that need to work with streaming time-series data\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL server ib Azure VMs\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL server on VMs enable you to use full version of SQL Server in the Cloud without having to manage any on-premises hardware. (IaaS approach)\n",
    "- replicates the database running on real on-premise hardware\n",
    "- no difference than moving database from one on-premises server to another\n",
    "- suitable for migrations and applications requiring access to OS features that might be unsupported at the PaaS level. \n",
    "- create rapid development and test without buying on-premise SQL Server hardware\n",
    "- lift-and-shift ready for existing applications => fast migration to the cloud with minimal changes or no changes\n",
    "- scale up the platform on which SQL Server is running by allocating more memory, CPU power, disk space to the VMs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Azure SQL Database Managed Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure SQL Managed instance runs a fully controllable instance of SQL Server in the coloud. (PaaS approach)\n",
    "- Complete control over this instance as much as you would for an on-premises server\n",
    "- SQL Managed Instance automates backups, software patching, database monitoring, and other general tasks\n",
    "- Offers features not available in Azure SQL database, example: if you systems use features such as linked servers, service broker, database mail\n",
    "- lift-and-shift an on-premises SQL server instance to the cloud without management overhead of running SQL Server on VMs\n",
    "- system admin can spend less time on admin tasks as these admin tasks can be automated by the managed instance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Azure SQL Database\n",
    "\n",
    "PaaS offred by Microsoft => you create a managed database server in the cloud and then deploy your databases on this server.\n",
    "- Microsoft manages the server so all you need to do is configure the database, create your tables and populate data. \n",
    "- single database:\n",
    "    - you can scale the database if you need more storage space, memory, or processing power\n",
    "    - resources are pre-allocated, you're charged per hour for the resource you've requested\n",
    "- elastic pool:\n",
    "    - multiple databases can share the same resources, such as memory, data storage space, processing power \n",
    "    - you create the pool and your database can use the resources from the pool\n",
    "    - useful if you have databases with resource requirements that vary overtime, allocate resource when you needed and release resource once processing has completed\n",
    "- best option for low cost within minimal administration (might not fully compatible with on-premises SQL server installations)\n",
    "- automatically updates, patches the SQL Server software\n",
    "- supports point in time restore, enable you to recover a database to the state it was in at any point in the past\n",
    "\n",
    "### Azure for open-source database\n",
    "\n",
    "MySQL -> leading open source relational database for Linux\n",
    "- community edition => free of charge\n",
    "- standard edition => higher performance, different technology for storing data\n",
    "- enterprise edition => comprehensive set of tools and features: enhanced security, availability, and scalability\n",
    "- Azure database for MySQL (PaaS implementation of MySQL in the Azure cloud):\n",
    "    - pay for waht you use\n",
    "    - automatic backups, point-in-time restore\n",
    "    - connection security, firewall rules, SSL connections\n",
    "    - provides a global databse system that scales up to large databases without the need to manage hardware, network components, virtual servers, software patches, etc\n",
    "    - concerned with security and administration \n",
    "\n",
    "MariaDB -> developped by original developers of MySQL\n",
    "- database engine has been rewritten and optimized for improved performance\n",
    "- compatibility with Oracle Database\n",
    "- built-in support for temporal data: a table can hold several versions of data, enableing an application to query the data as it appeared at some point in the past\n",
    "- Azure database for MariaDB (implementation of the MariaDB database management system adapted to run in Azure):\n",
    "    - fully managed by Azure, the system requires almost no additional administration\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL -> query language called pgsql\n",
    "- enable you to write stored procedures that run inside the database\n",
    "- Azure database for PostgreSQL (PaaS implementation of PostgreSQL in the Azure cloud, same avilability, performance, scalingm security and admin as MySQL service)\n",
    "    - some extensions might not available, example, writing stored procedures in various programming languages (other than pgsql) and interacting directly with OS\n",
    "    - records information about the queries run against databases on the server"
