## Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Computing services include common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking. Cloud services also expand the traditional IT offerings to include things like Internet of Things, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.

Because cloud computing uses the internet to deliver these services, it doesn't have to be constrained by physical infrastructure the same way that a traditional datacenter is. That means if you need to increase your IT infrastructure repidly, you don't have to wait to build a new datacenter - you can use the cloud to rapidly expand your IT footprint. 

## Define Cloud Models

### Private cloud

The natural evolution from a corporate datacenter. It's a cloud that's used by a single entity. Private cloud provides much greater control for the company and its IT department. However, it also comes with greater cost and fewer of the benefits of a public cloud deployment. Finally, private cloud may be hosted from your on site datacenter. It may also be hosted in a dedicated datacenter offsite, potentially even by a third party that has dedicated that datacenter to your company. 

### Public cloud

A public cloud is buil, controlled, and maintained by a thrid-party cloud provider. With a public cloud, anyone that wants to purchase cloud services can access and use resources. The general public availability is a key difference between public and private clouds.

### Hybrid cloud

A hybrid cloud uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment. It can be used to allow a private cloud to surge for increased, temporary demand by deploying public cloud resources. Hybrid cloud can be used to provide an extra layer of security. For example, users can flexibly choose which services to keep in public cloud and which to deploy to their private cloud infrastructure. 

### Multi-cloud

You use different features from multiple public cloud providers, or maybe you started your cloud journey with one provider and are in the process of migrating to a different provider. Regardless, in a multi-cloud environment you deal with two (or more) public cloud providers and manage resources and security in both environments. 

## Consumption-based models

### Capital expenditure (CapEx)

- one time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resource, for example, new building, repaving the parking lot, building a data center, buying company vehicles 

### Operational expenditure (OpEx)

- money spent on services or products over time, for example, renting a convention center, leasing a company vehicle, signing up for cloud services
- this is where cloud computing falls under becuase you don't pay for the physical infrastructure, the electricity, the security, or anything else associated with maintaning a datacenter. Instead, you only pay for the IT resources you use. If you don't use any IT resources this month, you don't pay for any IT resources. 


## Benefits of using cloud

- High availability: ensuring maximum availability, regardless of disruptions or events that may occur
- Scalability: ability to adjust resources to meet demand, you can add more resources to better handle the increased demand, you aren't overpaying for services
    - Vertical scaling: need more processing power, scale up to add more CPUs, RAM to the virtual machine
    - Horizontal scaling: if you suddenly experienced a steep jump in demand, you deployed resources could be scaled out. For example, you can add additional virtual machines or containers. 
- Realiability: ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. The cloud by its decentralized design, natually supports a reliable and resilient infrastructure. 
- Predictability: let you move forward with confidence.
    - Performance: focuses on predicting the resources needed to deliver a positive experience. Autoscaling, load balancing, and high availability are just some of the cloud concepts that support performance predictability. 
    - Cost: focuses on predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend. Track your resource use in a real time, monitor resources to ensure that you are using the most efficient way, and apply data analytics to find patterns and trends that help better plan resource deployments.

## Services Types

- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is the most flexible category of cloud services, as it provides you the maximum amount of control for your cloud resources. In an IaaS model, the cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the hardware, network connectivity (to the internet), and physical security. You’re responsible for everything else: operating system installation, configuration, and maintenance; network configuration; database and storage configuration; and so on. With IaaS, you’re essentially renting the hardware in a cloud datacenter, but what you do with that hardware is up to you.
- Platform as a service (PaaS) is a middle ground between renting space in a datacenter (infrastructure as a service) and paying for a complete and deployed solution (software as a service). In a PaaS environment, the cloud provider maintains the physical infrastructure, physical security, and connection to the internet. They also maintain the operating systems, middleware, development tools, and business intelligence services that make up a cloud solution. In a PaaS scenario, you don't have to worry about the licensing or patching for operating systems and databases. PaaS is well suited to provide a complete development environment without the headache of maintaining all the development infrastructure.
- Software as a service (SaaS) is the most complete cloud service model from a product perspective. With SaaS, you’re essentially renting or using a fully developed application. Email, financial software, messaging applications, and connectivity software are all common examples of a SaaS implementation. While the SaaS model may be the least flexible, it’s also the easiest to get up and running. It requires the least amount of technical knowledge or expertise to fully employ.
